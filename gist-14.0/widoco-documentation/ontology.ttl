The subproperties allow the ontologist to do three things:
1) Distinguish start and end times.
2) Indicate whether a time is planned or actual. This is useful for everything from project management to calendar appointments and the like. It is also useful for date effectivities; i.e., something valid up to a planned date).
3) Distinguish varying levels of precision; sort of a simple version of the Allen functions.

All datetimes are of the same format: '2021-06-01T08:03:27.12324-6:00'^^xsd:dateTime. This is compatible with and a subset of ISO 8601.

Time zone offset, such as -6:00 (of which there are a few dozen) is recognized in the date itself, as shown. The actual time zone standard (of which there are 131) may optionally be attached to the event or other object itself.

There will be many historical dates that do not have a time zone offset (e.g., Lincoln's birthday, as well as about 75% of all legacy systems), and in that case the offset can be omitted.

The conventions for precision that are repeated in each property name are as follows:
	- *DateTime is an abstraction over the various precisions of its subproperties.
	- *Date refers to a calendar date (e.g., birthdays and invoice dates) and is assumed to have precision of one day. Time zone offset is allowed.
	- *Minute refers to clock time; e.g., a meeting will start at 9:15 with a timezone offset. Precision is assumed to have precision of one minute.
	- *Microsecond refers to system time, and it will be as precise as the system can supply; typically at least milliseconds, sometime microseconds.""" .

We may have knowledge that Judge Jones is more lenient on repeat offenders in the morning; we may know that the earliest killing frost in Fort Collins is the last week of September.

These fit the broader definition of knowledge, the distillation of experience. But they do not require any new instances.  Judge Jones and Fort Collins already exist and have a place in our knowledge graph.

But some knowledge requires that we synthesize new instances in order to have a place to consolidate the knowledge.  A disease isn't a tangible thing, like a person or a building. A disease is a prediction that a person's health will decline in a predictable way (without treatment and with treatment). The number of diseases continues to grow as we collectively learn more and more granular distinctions. Lung cancer used to be a single disease, but now we have dozens of fine-grained distinctions; e.g., non-lymphoma small cell fusiform is different from alveolar adenocarcinoma because we now know the prognosis and treatment are different.

This superclass is meant as a place for subclasses that will have the instances that represent the foci of the knowledge we have acquired. Note the distinction between a particular portion of, say, gold, which instantiates gist:PhysicalSubstance, and the concept of gold, which instantiates gist:KnowledgeConcept.

In some ontologies what we are calling knowledge concepts are defined as classes; e.g., non-lymphoma small cell fusiform and alveolar adenocarcinoma would be two classes rather than two instances. But using a class makes it harder to connect the concept to other instances in a knowledge graph, and furthermore such classes would lack instances.""" .
